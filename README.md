# Module_5_For_Loop_Problems

Problem One:
Write a program that uses a for loop to print “Hello world” 100 times.

Problem Two:
Take the following list of numbers and use a for loop to print each number and its
square to the screen, each value on a new line:
num_list = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]

Problem Three:
Write a program that uses a for loop and the turtle module to do the following:
- Ask the user for the length of a side, a fill color, and what shape they would like to draw
(either a triangle or a square)
- Use a loop to draw the shape the user chose with their chosen side length and fill color
- Each angle in a triangle is 120°, each angle in a square is 90°

Problem Four:
Write a program that does the following:
- Print the numbers 1 through 50 to the screen
- For numbers evenly divisible by 3, print “Divisible by 3” instead of the number
- For numbers evenly divisible by 5, print “Divisible by 5” instead of the number
- For numbers evenly divisible by both 3 and 5, print “Divisible by both”
HINTS: The steps in your if/elif/else statement will be different from the order of the steps in
this bulleted list. You will need the modulo (%) operator.
